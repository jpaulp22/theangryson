                                I have always been inclined to the arts, whether it be through playing music, taking pictures, or visiting museums. From a young age I learned to play the guitar thanks to my exposure to 70s, 80s and 90s rock. My dad served as a cornerstone for my musical palate. Expanding my musical taste throughout the years, in high school I played in the school jazz band and fell in love with jazz so much that I ended up being part of a jazz trio. It was here that I flourished as a musician and an artist, learning complex music theory and pushing me to take up musical production. At the same time, I was also pursuing another passion, coding. I always viewed coding as the profession I would make a career out of, with music being just a hobby. I ended up graduating with honors in music theory & Spanish, the NYS Seal of Biliteracy, and chose to pursue Computer Science in Hunter College with a minor in Music.

                                While maintaining a high GPA, there would be one class that would stop me from completing the Computer Science major â€“ Discrete Mathematics. Took the class a total of 3 times and never got past it. I was ready to abandon coding as a major and convert to a music major. A friend of mine ended up introducing me to an alternative major, Emerging Media, which would allow me to continue coding but using HTML, CSS, and JS as the core languages, front-end essentially. I had little JS experience and up until that point had become well versed in Python and C++ so learning HTML and CSS was an easy
                                task. Along the journey I also learned valuable lessons in photography, graphic design, photo editing, documentary production, and 2D animation. This major propelled me headfirst into the world of the arts, something I had been attached to since a young age. I was now able to mesh my two passions, coding and art, into one.
